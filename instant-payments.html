                    <h3>What Does “Instant Payment” Mean?</h3>
                    <p>An instant payment is a transaction where
                        funds are
                        transferred and
                        settled between accounts in real time,
                        typically
                        within 20 seconds
                        or less. This means the recipient has
                        immediate
                        access to the money,
                        unlike traditional transfers that may take
                        hours or
                        days to process.
                        Instant payments are available around the
                        clock,
                        providing unmatched
                        speed and convenience for both personal and
                        business
                        transactions.
